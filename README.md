Main reason for the fork was so I can use alarm control panel to open my door with password got idea from here: https://github.com/esphome/feature-requests/issues/2058.

# Custom Alarm Panel Card

This custom alarm panel card was forked in September 2020 from [Kevin Cooper's repo](https://github.com/JumpMaster/custom-lovelace) (no relation). 

I have included my complete working [manual alarm control panel](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/) configuration, automations, script, lovelace dashboard, etc in the [ExampleConfig](https://github.com/jcooper-korg/AlarmPanel/tree/master/ExampleConfig) folder.

## News

This card was last tested working with Home Assistant 2024.9.0. HA occasionally makes breaking changes, and I don't constantly update my system so I may not notice if it becomes broken.

Previous versions of this card included a custom version of the HA manual_alarm_panel component. This is no longer supported. If you had installed a previous version of this card, you should remove it from `/config/custom_components/manual`. Optional backstory: I had modified that component to publish a state_duration attribute for use with my countdown timer. But the HA team [rejected my pull request](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/41872), so I have since removed it, and now require the durations to be specified in the card config, as detailed below. 
 

## Card Modification Goals 

* improve the appearance of the arm/disarm and keypad buttons (which are too small on current Home Assistant versions)
* high visibility and ergonomically sized buttons on web, iOS companion app, and wall mounted tablet
* hide the key pad when disarmed (if `alarm_control_panel.code_arm_required` is off)
* add a config option to show Ready / Not Ready when disarmed, monitoring a given list of entities
* add a config option to show a countdown timer when arming or pending

I changed the buttons from mwc-button to regular buttons. I couldn't find a reliable way to make the mwc-buttons larger (even using tools like [Thomas Loven's card mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)), and they were just much too small on a wall-mounted tablet.

I moved the Disarm button from the top button row to the keypad, to the right of the 0 button. This allows the overall keypad area and button size to be increased, which is helpful on a phone screen or wall mounted tablet.

## Installation

To use this card in Home Assistant:

<img src="https://github.com/jcooper-korg/AlarmPanel/blob/master/Screenshots/Installation-Resource.png?raw=true" width="400">


* copy the `alarm_control_panel-card.js` into the www folder in your config folder (create the www folder if it's missing, and restart Home Assistant)
* install it as a custom Lovelace resource in Configuration > Lovelace Dashboards > Resources. 
	* Turn on Advanced Mode in your user profile if you can't see the Resources tab. 
	* The Url of the file will be `/local/alarm_control_panel-card.js`, and the type is "JavaScript Module".  
	* If you are making local modifications to the file, you can add a version number to the end of the Url, like `/local/alarm_control_panel-card.js?v=3` and increment the number each time you make a change, to force it to use the new version instead of your browser cached version.
* add the alarm panel to your lovelace view using a Manual card, with type set as `type: 'custom:alarm_control_panel-card'` and specify your alarm\_control\_panel entity as named in your configuration.yaml (e.g. `entity: alarm_control_panel.house`). See my [example AlarmLovelaceDashboard yaml configs](https://github.com/jcooper-korg/AlarmPanel/blob/master/ExampleConfig).

## Card configuration options

See the [ExampleConfig](https://github.com/jcooper-korg/AlarmPanel/tree/master/ExampleConfig) folder for my configuration files. See details on my setup in the Example Configuration section below.

The card options are:

* `entity`: (required string) the name of the manual `alarm_control_panel` entity
* `show_countdown_timer`: (optional boolean). default false. set to true to show countdown timer, or false to hide it.  If enabled, you must also configure the `durations` list, specifying a duration in seconds for the arming, and pending states. These times should match the times you specified in your manual config.
* `color_countdown_timer`: (optional string). If empty then color changes from green to orange to red, else it uses color provided.
* `scale`: (optional string). default is 14px. increase/decrease the size of the buttons/text/etc by changing this number
* `title`: (optional string) if provided will show this title at the top of the card, and the alarm state will be below it. if not provided, will show the alarm state as the title (which saves some vertical space, if you are space constrained, like on a wall tablet)
* `states`: (optional list). list of arming states to support. Default is `armed_away` and `armed_home` (states are shown below). If you use more than two, you may need to adjust the `.actions button` widths. 
* `confirm_entities`: (optional list) a list of sensors which will be continuously monitored when disarmed so it can show Ready/Not ready text in the card header.  If `confirm_entities` is specified, you may optionally also set `disable_arm_if_not_ready` to disable the arm buttons and auto_enter action unless all the listed sensors are ready. And if `disable_arm_if_not_ready` is set, you may also optionally set `show_override_if_not_ready` to show an override checkbox when the entities are not ready, which will re-enable the arming buttons (allowing you, for example, to arm the alarm but leave a window open).
* `labels`: (optional list) list of text replacements, allowing you to customize the text that is shown. Supported labels (states are shown below):
	* `ui.card.alarm_control_panel.arm_away`
 	* `ui.card.alarm_control_panel.arm_home`
  	* `ui.card.alarm_control_panel.clear_code`
  	* `ready`
  	* `not_ready`
  	* `state.alarm_control_panel.<state>.icon.text`
  	* `state.alarm_control_panel.<state>.icon.mdi`
  	* `state.alarm_control_panel.<state>.icon.label_badge_color`
  	* `state.alarm_control_panel.<state>`
  	
* `display_letters`: (optional boolean) shows letters on number pad buttons like a telephone keypad
* `style`: (optional string) this text will be appended to the card css style, allowing you to override colors, etc. Also see [Thomas Loven's card mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
* `auto_hide`: (optional boolean) hides the keypad and action buttons. click on the badge to show/hide them.  
* `auto_enter`: (optional object). you must also specify `code_length` and `arm_action`. This will automatically disarm or arm with the specified arm\_action when entering the code. When a code of the correct length is entered and the alarm is currently armed, the alarm will be disarmed. If `alarm_control_panel.code_arm_required` is on and the alarm is currently disarmed, and a code of the correct length is entered, the arm_action will be triggered (e.g. 'arm\_home' or 'arm\_away'). 

Label badge colors (non-exhaustive):
* `label-badge-green`
* `label-badge-yellow`
* `label-badge-red`
* `label-badge-blue`

States are:
* `armed_away`
* `armed_custom_bypass`
* `armed_home`
* `armed_night`
* `disarmed` - also for `label_badge_color`
* `pending` - also for `label_badge_color`
* `triggered` - also for `label_badge_color`
* `armed` - only for `label_badge_color`
  
## My Setup

My alarm setup consists of:

* Home Assistant running on Hass.io, on a [Raspberry Pi 3b+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* a wall-mounted 7" Amazon Fire Tablet, running [Fully Kiosk](https://www.fully-kiosk.com). NOTE: you may need to manually update the WebView component on older Fire tablets. Mine is a 7th Gen (2017), running FireOS 5.1.1, and the [latest compatible WebView is v110](https://amazon-system-webview.en.uptodown.com/android/versions)
* the iOS [Home Assistant Companion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-assistant/id1099568401)
* an alarm panel kit from [Konnected.io](https://konnected.io/collections/shop-now) with various door/window/motion/smoke sensors, and a siren, beeper, and red/green LEDs

## Example Configuration
My config files are in the [ExampleConfig](https://github.com/jcooper-korg/AlarmPanel/tree/master/ExampleConfig) folder. 

* My Alarm lovelace dashboard has two cards- the new custom alarm panel card, and a [Conditional Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/conditional) which shows when any of the door/window sensors is opened, while disarmed.
* I have configured the custom card with:
	* label replacements to use shorter all-caps words for the AWAY, HOME, etc.
	* `confirm_entities` list of sensors, so that it shows "Ready" if they're all off, or "Not ready" if any are on
	* `disable_arm_if_not_ready` and `show_override_if_not_ready` both set, so the arm buttons are disabled unless all the `confirm_entities` are ready, or the override checkbox is checked
	* countdown timer enabled and durations in seconds specified for arming (60) and pending (30) to match the `arming_time` and `delay_time` in the manual platform's armed_away config
* I have set up automations to handle:
	* turning on/off the green/red LEDs, beeper, and siren based on sensor entity states and the manual `alarm_control_panel` armed/disarmed/triggered state
	* notifying our iphones when armed / disarmed or when triggered
	* triggering the alarm on smoke sensors, regardless of arming state
* In order to include the name of the entity that triggered the alarm in the trigger notifications, I'm using an `input_text` entity in my config, which is set when the alarm trigger automation runs, and is then referenced by the notification
* In order to be able to trigger the alarm immediately for some sensors, while other sensors (e.g. entry doors) are delayed, I have a script called `trigger_alarm_immediately` which first disarms the alarm, and then triggers. Requires that the the `delay_time` is set to 0 for the disarmed state in the `alarm_control_panel` configuration.
* I created a separate user named Alarm Panel that I use to log in from my wall mounted tablet. I'm using [Custom Header](https://maykar.github.io/custom-header) to hide the sidebar and title bar on the wall mounted tablet for that user.
